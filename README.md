# 🌐 Full Stack Open 2025 – Hands-on with React, Express, MongoDB, GraphQL & testing 🧪⚛️
This repository contains my personal journey through the Full Stack Open course offered by the University of Helsinki. The course focuses on modern web development with JavaScript, covering both frontend and backend using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, GraphQL, TypeScript, and testing libraries. Each part of the course is organized into folders, reflecting the structure of the course itself. The repo includes all my code, exercises, and project work as I progress through each module.

My goal is to not only complete the exercises but also to deepen my understanding of full stack development principles, best practices, and modern tooling.
